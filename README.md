# Axper

Axper is an app designed for users to earn tokens for positive behaviour. 

## How to use it

The first Page is the home page, here regular users can choose from pre determined activities to earn tokens.
Once they finished a activity they can submit it for approval. Should it be approved they recieve a certain amount of our custom token.
We also promote positive social behavior by offering users to do group activities with other users.

The second page is the government page, designated for moderators. Here moderators can see the approval requests from users. The pending requests can be either denied or approved 
after determening theier validity. 

The third page is the redeem page. Here users can exchange their tokens for certain rewards.
